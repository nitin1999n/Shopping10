# React Native Project
## Description
This project is a simple React Native application that utilizes `@react-navigation/native-stack` and `@react-navigation/native` for navigation. It includes examples of using `NavigationContainer`, `PropsWithChildren`, and `toLocaleString()`.

## Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

• Node.js
• npm or yarn
• React Native CLI

## Steps
1. Clone the repository:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install `@react-navigation/native-stack` and `@react-navigation/native`:
```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack
```

4. Install additional dependencies for React Navigation:
```bash
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```
5. For iOS, install the CocoaPods dependencies:
```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Usage
### Running the Application

For Android:
```bash
npx react-native run-android
```
For iOS:
```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```
## Example Code
Here is an example of how to set up and use `NavigationContainer` and `PropsWithChildren` in your project:
```bash
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

type PropsWithChildren<P> = P & { children?: React.ReactNode };

const HomeScreen: React.FC<PropsWithChildren<{}>> = ({ navigation }) => {
  const date = new Date().toLocaleString();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to the Home Screen</Text>
      <Text>Current Date and Time: {date}</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

const DetailsScreen: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={DetailsScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Notes
Make sure to run `npx react-native start` before running the application on your device or simulator.
The example code demonstrates basic navigation and usage of `toLocaleString()` to format the current date and time.
